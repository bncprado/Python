''' VARIABLES
Is super straight forward to declare variables in Python. Just type the name of the variable followed by its value
'''

variable = 'string'
number = 10
is_true = True
is_false = False
boolean = 3.14

Python variables have a few characteristics worth noting:

Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. The type is automatically inferred based on the value assigned to it. For example, you can assign an integer to a variable and later assign a string to the same variable without any issues.

Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, so x and X are treated as different variables.

Variable Naming Rules:

Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
They must start with a letter or an underscore but not with a digit.
Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters like !, @, #, etc.
It's a good practice to use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable.

#PYTHON also uses snake_case as rule to separate the words in a variable name. EX:

snake_case = 'Python'
