"""You've continued to demonstrate your understanding of lists and list syntax.

You've identified the correct method needed to complete this task - .count(). 
You've used it correctly, giving it an arguement to work with, and it returns the amount of times that arguement appears in the list.

Thank you for putting your results in context using a formatted string! 
It's a very clear response for me - without seeing your code I know what these numbers refer to. 
There are some unexpected results, because you've missed a few items while copying the list down, 
but all of your processes and techniques used are correct! Well done!"""
