"""This is a simple and efficient submission with all the necessary pieces. 
You've defined your function, giving it the parameter to work with in place of knowing the person's name at the point.

Using input for your arguement is great - and more realistic. There wouldn't be many situations where you hard code a name in!

Remember to use snake_case when possible. 
Though it doesn't impact the functionality of your code, whatsyourname to whats_your_name is a big difference for readability!

Well done!"""
