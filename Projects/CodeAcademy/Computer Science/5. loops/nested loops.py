1.We have provided the list sales_data that shows the number of scoops sold for different flavors of ice cream at three different locations: Scoopcademy, Gilberts Creamery, and Mannyâ€™s Scoop Shop.

We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold across all three locations. Start by defining a variable scoops_sold and set it to zero.

2.Loop through the sales_data list using the following guidelines:

For our temporary variable of the for loop, call it location.
print() out each location list.

3.Within our sales_data loop, nest a secondary loop to go through each location sublist element and add the element value to scoops_sold.

By the end, you should have the sum of every number in the sales_data nested list.
