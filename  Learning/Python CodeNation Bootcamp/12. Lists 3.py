"""I really appreciate how clear you make your code for a user - 
you've written really good, very specific instructions to them. 
They won't necessarily follow them - but you've given them a lot of guidance!

By asking them to choose a number from 0-5, you've shown how the index position is the key to this activity, 
and you've saved that value to a variable for future use. 
I like the addional if statement at the end - 
we specified that the user shouldn't see the lists before they pick their words, 
but being able to see it after and see what they could have chosen is a nice touch, well done!"""
