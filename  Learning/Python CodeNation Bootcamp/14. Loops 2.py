"""Well done on your work on this task! Nested loops (loops inside loops) are quite challenging, 
because it's hard to think of the two processes going on at the same time, 
but you've tackled this perfectly. 
Naming your variables as i and j make total sense, they're consecutive, and convention-wise, the is acknowledged as a nested loop.

I expected the printed results to show this like:

1 x 1 = 1

1 x 2 = 2

However, I'm actually really impressed with your use of the \t escape to line those items up nicely! 
You've shown great research skills there by finding out about "end". This works really well!"""
