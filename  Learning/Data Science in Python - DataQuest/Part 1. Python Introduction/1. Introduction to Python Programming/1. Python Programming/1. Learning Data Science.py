Welcome to Introduction to Python!

If you're diving into data science for the first time, learning Python programming goes hand-in-hand with learning data science fundamentals. There's no limit to what you can do by learning Python programming, and expanding your skill set means expanding your career opportunities — and your earning potential.

We’ve designed this course for beginners — no previous math, stats, or programming experience required — so you can start learning right away.

Here are a few takeaways you can expect by the end of this lesson:

- How computer programs work
- How to write and execute computer programs
- How to perform mathematical operations in Python
- How to use code comments

By the end of this first course, we'll know how to do the following:

- Save values using variables
- Work with numbers and text data
- Convert data types
- Employ lists, and lists of lists in Python

At the end of the second course, we'll work on a project together. Since we will help guide you and provide suggestions along the way, we call it a Guided Project. We'll have some fun in this Guided Project and we'll analyze a dataset of helicopter prison escapes! Did you know that the country with the most helicopter prison escape attempts is France? We'll use Python to create this frequency table showing our results:

Country	        Number of Occurrences
France	        15
United States	  8
Belgium	        4
Canada	        4
Greece	        4
Australia	      2
Brazil	        2
United Kingdom	2
Mexico	        1
Ireland	        1
Italy	          1
Puerto Rico	    1
Chile	          1
Netherlands   	1
Russia	        1
