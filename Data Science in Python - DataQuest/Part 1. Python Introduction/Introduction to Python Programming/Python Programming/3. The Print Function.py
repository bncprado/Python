In the previous exercise, we instructed the computer to perform a single calculation: print(23 + 7). The computer followed the instruction and returned 30 as a result.

However, we can ask the computer to perform more than just one calculation. Let's demonstrate this using data from a real dataset.

Throughout this lesson, we'll learn core Python programming concepts in the context of real data. We'll be using data from the table below, which provides some information about five mobile applications from the iOS store:

track_name                  price	  currency	  rating_count_tot	  user_rating
Facebook	                  0.0	    USD	        2974676	            3.5
Instagram	                  0.0	    USD	        2161558	            4.5
Clash of Clans	            0.0	    USD	        2130805	            4.5
Fruit Ninja Classic	        1.99	  USD	        698516	            4.5
Minecraft: Pocket Edition	  6.99	  USD	        522012	            4.5

Data source: Mobile App Store Dataset (Ramanathan Perumal)

In the examples below we instruct the computer to perform two calculations:

The cost of purchasing the Facebook app (0.00) and the Fruit Ninja Classic app (1.99)
The difference in the total number of user ratings submitted for Facebook (2974676) and Instagram (2161558)
"""
print(0.00 + 1.99)
print(2974676 - 2161558)

"""
Output
"""
1.99
813118

"""
To display both results, we need to use the print() function. The total cost of purchasing Facebook and Fruit Ninja Classic is 1.99 Facebook has 813118 more user rating results than Instagram

Now let's practice using the print() function with more than one calculation.

Instructions
Using the print() function, display the results for the following operations:

0.00 + 6.99, the cost of purchasing Instagram and Minecraft: Pocket Edition
4.5 - 3.5, the difference in the average rating score for Facebook and Instagram
